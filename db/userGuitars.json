    "notes": "By 1968, interest in the Les Pauls of the '50s was on the rise thanks to their use by such players as Eric Clapton. When Gibson first brought back the Les Paul Standard, the new model was most similar to the 1956 model with a Goldtop finish and two P-90 pickups instead of humbuckers. These guitars can essentially be seen as the first Gibson Les Paul reissues. The original '68 models are very close to the a '50s Les Paul save for a few details such as Indian instead of Brazilian Rosewood for the fingerboard and chrome instead of nickel hardware. This model would evolve into the Les Paul Deluxe of the early '70s.",

    "notes": "Like the Les Paul Standard, Gibson brought back the Les Paul Custom in 1968. This model was also very similar to its '50s counterparts, but featured a Maple top on the Mahogany body, where most '50s Customs used all Mahogany bodies. Both of these reissue models changed through 1969 with the introduction of a three-ply 'pancake body' and a three-piece laminated Mahogany neck with a volute (a small bump) where the neck meets the headstock. For collectors, these changes all signify a steady departure from the pinnacle designs of the '50s and the beginning of a general decline in quality that would continue into the '70s and the much maligned Norlin era.",

By keeping the bridge in contact with the body, the guitar itself is acoustically louder, which improves the signal to noise ratio of the single-coil pickups. ",

    "notes": "I’ve had and tried many PRS, but this one exceeds all of them. It was signed by Paul himself with a gold ink pencil on the back plate at Peach guitars (UK) and it comes with a letter signed by the owner itself stating its authenticity. Both a collection piece and an unrivaled instrument with the unique, creamy PRS sound.",
