# guitArchive (NSS Front-End Capstone)

## Technologies Used
1. HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript
2. React Bootstrap, Bootstrap & SASS 0.5.0: All customized styling
3. React: For bundling components and building the UI

## Description
guitArchive was born out of the idea that there are many secondhand vintage guitar owners who'd like to find more details about their prized vintage instruments. Guitarists can use this application to find more details about the guitar models of their favorite vintage guitar brands, along with detailed specifications of other users' guitars, so they are hopefully able to narrow down the range of years within which their instrument was made. Upon authenticating, users are able to add, edit, and delete their own vintage guitar as well as view custom Tone Tip suggestions to help them find the right amp to meet their needs whether they are a current vintage guitar owner, or are simply in the market to see what guitars are out there. Over time as the database grows, and users have a larger range of instrument data to look at, this application can help keep the history of these guitars alive long after they're gone, as well as keep a record of current instruments that will one day be considered vintage in their own right.

## How to run
1. Clone down this project.
2. Go to: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server` and install "http-server".  
2. Navigate to the project folder in command line interface and type: `http-server -p 8888`  
3. This will show at: `http://localhost:8888` in your internet browser.  

Or you can launch your web browser and navigate to the following deployed link of the project:
https://guitarchive.firebaseapp.com/auth

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
